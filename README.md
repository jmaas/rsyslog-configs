This repository contains rsyslog configuration files useful in many logmanagement environments.
The main goal is to have a set of easily reusable configuration files that are tested, proven and well documented. 

Ofcourse the main focus in these samples is on confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, reliability and scalability.

Contributing configuration samples and/or use-cases is encouraged! Just fork this repository and send me a PR.
